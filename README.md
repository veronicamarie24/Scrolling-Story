# Scrolling Story Project

This is a "story" featuring a portfolio about myself. I created this layout with the idea of using PHP includes, but here there is just HTML and CSS.

The story features 3 pages, which all link to each other relatively within their folder. The front page is an outline of my personality and current projects. Two separate pages are included titled “About Me” and “Projects”, which I use to give more detail on things presented on the homepage. I wanted the layout to represent me and my personality as being serious about my work, but still fun. <br /><br />
