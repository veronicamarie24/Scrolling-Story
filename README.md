# Scrolling Story Project

This is a "story" featuring a portfolio about myself. I created this layout with the idea of using PHP includes, but here there is just HTML and CSS.

The story features 3 pages, which all link to each other relatively within their folder. The front page is an outline of my personality and current projects. Two separate pages are included titled “About Me” and “Projects”, which I use to give more detail on things presented on the homepage. I wanted the layout to represent me and my personality as being serious about my work, but still fun. <br /><br />

I stuck to using one major font throughout the website because it kept the page clean and readable. Roboto is a serious and modern font that fit the theme of my layout. <br /><br /><br />

The color palette reflects a serious, but playful tone. I use the contrast between the dark gray next to the soft pink at the top of the layout to attract your eye to that part of the page first. I picked the gray and brown to symbolize my hardworking mindset, but the pink shows my friendly and girly side. I've worked with men during my internships, since I work with engineers. Even though I am professional, I can still be feminine. <br /><br />
